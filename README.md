Pssst is a simple and secure way to exchange information. We do not provide
services by our self, but we provide you with the tools to start your own
service. These tools build upon open-source software and use strong end-to-end
encryption. Pssst comes with a [command line tool](src/cli) and
[server](src/server).

```
$ pssst push me you "Hello"
```
