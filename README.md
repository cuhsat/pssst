Pssst ![](https://travis-ci.org/cuhsat/pssst.svg)
=====
Pssst is a simple and secure way to exchange information. It comes with a
[server](src/server) and a [command line interface](src/cli) and can easily 
be deployed to [Heroku](https://github.com/cuhsat/heroku-buildpack-pssst)).
It is based upon open-source software and uses strong end-to-end encryption.

```
$ pssst push me you "Hello"
```
