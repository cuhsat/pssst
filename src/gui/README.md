GUI
===
Pssst HTML user interface.

Usage
-----
`$ pssst [option|port]`

Start
-----
Just run the `start.sh` script to start the GUI:

`$ start.sh`

This will also download and install all necessary packages at the first start.

Install
-------
At least [required](pip.txt):

* CherryPy 3.2.2
* Bower 1.3.12

As the GUI uses the CLI as a proxy, those requirements apply here also.
